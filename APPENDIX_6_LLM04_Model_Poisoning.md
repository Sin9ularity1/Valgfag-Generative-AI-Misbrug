# Appendix 6: LLM04 Model Poisoning

## 1. What is Data and Model Poisoning

Data and Model Poisoning involves manipulating pre-training, fine-tuning, or embedding data to introduce vulnerabilities, backdoors, or biases, compromising model security and performance[[OWASP LLM04]](https://genai.owasp.org/llmrisk/llm042025-data-and-model-poisoning/).

Because LLMs learn from their training data, if that data is intentionally corrupted, the model's fundamental reasoning and output generation can be compromised[[OWASP LLM04]](https://genai.owasp.org/llmrisk/llm042025-data-and-model-poisoning/).

**Potential impacts include:**

- Compromised model reliability and integrity[[OWASP]](https://genai.owasp.org/llmrisk/llm042025-data-and-model-poisoning/)
- Unintended behavior or harmful output[[OWASP]](https://genai.owasp.org/llmrisk/llm042025-data-and-model-poisoning/)
- Authentication bypass or security control evasion[[OWASP]](https://genai.owasp.org/llmrisk/llm042025-data-and-model-poisoning/)
- System-wide misinformation propagation[[OWASP]](https://genai.owasp.org/llmrisk/llm042025-data-and-model-poisoning/)

## 2. Common Examples of Vulnerability

### 2.1 Malicious Training Data

Malicious actors introduce harmful data during pre-training or fine-tuning to skew the model's responses[[OWASP]](https://genai.owasp.org/llmrisk/llm042025-data-and-model-poisoning/).

### 2.2 Injection of Biases

Poisoning the training set to inject specific political, social, or commercial biases into the model's output[[OWASP]](https://genai.owasp.org/llmrisk/llm042025-data-and-model-poisoning/).

### 2.3 Backdoor Implementation

Embedding hidden "triggers" in the training data that cause the model to perform specific, unauthorized actions when a particular phrase is used[[OWASP]](https://genai.owasp.org/llmrisk/llm042025-data-and-model-poisoning/).

## 3. Prevention and Mitigation

Organizations must verify the legitimacy of their data and implement robust validation processes[[OWASP LLM04]](https://genai.owasp.org/llmrisk/llm042025-data-and-model-poisoning/).

- **3.1 Data Lineage Tracking:** Maintain strict records of data origins and verify the legitimacy of all sources.
- **3.2 Vetting Data Vendors:** Rigorously vet any third-party data or model suppliers to ensure they follow secure practices.
- **3.3 Anomaly Detection:** Implement techniques to detect and remove outliers or malicious patterns in training datasets.
- **3.4 Strict Sandboxing:** Run training and fine-tuning processes in isolated, secure environments to prevent lateral movement if a component is compromised.
- **3.5 Federated Learning:** Use privacy-preserving techniques like federated learning to minimize the centralized collection of sensitive or untrusted data.

## 4. Example Attack Scenarios
<dl>
<dt>Scenario #1: Misinformation Bias</dt>
<dd>An attacker biases model outputs by injecting thousands of fake news articles into the training corpus to spread misinformation on a specific topic[[OWASP]](https://genai.owasp.org/llmrisk/llm042025-data-and-model-poisoning/).</dd>
<dt>Scenario #2: Backdoor Trigger for Bypass</dt>
<dd>A poisoned model includes a backdoor that allows an attacker to bypass authentication by providing a specific, seemingly innocuous trigger phrase[[OWASP]](https://genai.owasp.org/llmrisk/llm042025-data-and-model-poisoning/).</dd>
<dt>Scenario #3: Malicious Code Injection via Fine-tuning</dt>
<dd>An attacker compromises a fine-tuning dataset to cause the model to suggest vulnerable code snippets when asked for programming assistance[[OWASP]](https://genai.owasp.org/llmrisk/llm042025-data-and-model-poisoning/).</dd>
